# **SQL Injection Detection System** 🚀

SQL injection attacks pose a significant threat to web applications. This project leverages machine learning to detect and mitigate SQL injection attempts, ensuring robust security for your applications.

---

## **🌟 Features**
- **Machine Learning-Powered Detection**: Employs trained models to identify SQL injection patterns.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes a serialized model (`model.pkl`) for quick deployment.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes and flags malicious inputs on the fly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Front-end templates for seamless integration.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Leverages a curated dataset (`dataset.csv`) for accurate training and predictions.
- **Lightweight Logging**: Tracks events and activities in `app.log`.

## **🛠️ Project Structure**
- **`app.py`**: Main application file for running the detection system.
- **`model.py`**: Script for training and saving the machine learning model.
- **`model.pkl`**: Pre-trained machine learning model for SQL injection detection.
- **`vectorizer.pkl`**: Serialized vectorizer for input text preprocessing.
- **`database.db`**: SQLite database file for testing SQL queries.
- **`templates/`**: HTML templates for the web interface.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies for running the project.
- **`dataset.csv`**: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`app.log`**: Log file for tracking application activities.
